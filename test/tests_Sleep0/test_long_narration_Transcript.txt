Amanuensis Transcription - test_long_narration
==============================================
this is a long duration I'm going to spend some time making this video file this isn't a video file this is an audio file

seems strange that I would have to do this but I guess that's what I have to do

I'm curious to know how this is going to segment I'm really curious to know if it will fall under the 15 second clips

what that didn't make any sense why did not make any sense not really sure

I'm only a 30 Seconds right now


no I'm at 40 seconds I wanted to see what that blank space we do to my segmentation I wanted to see just exactly how old is Tim file is going to work

I'm approaching 1 minute now so I'm going to sign off from this record

talking talking talking and more talking
